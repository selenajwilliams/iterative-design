          <h2>Reimagining the Real Estate Experience with Bramble</h2>
          <p><i><b>What does it take to build trust in a platform that promises to save you tens of thousands of dollars?</i></b>
            That’s the question that guided our team as we took on the challenge of redesigning Bramble’s desktop website. As a new real estate brokerage with bold claims and cutting-edge technology, Bramble needs an interface that not only reflects its innovation but also instills confidence in buyers and sellers navigating one of the most important decisions of their lives.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Bramble?</h2>
            <p>
                Bramble is a modern, AI-powered real estate brokerage that offers end-to-end home buying/selling services for a flat fee, replacing the traditional 2-3% agent commission with a simpler, cheaper model. Buyers receive a substantial rebate (averaging $20,000) while still benefiting from human agent support. Notable features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>AI semantic search to match listings to user intent</li>
                    <li>AI-generated video tours based on listing photographs</li>
                    <li>Flat-fee structure that promotes affordability and transparency</li>
                    <li>Licensed human agent for guidance</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
            <p><b>We wanted the interface to reflect the innovative nature of Bramble, while establishing trust</b>–especially for users encountering these ideas for the first time. Selling or buying a home is a big deal, and we needed users to feel confident using a new platform that introduces such a different model. <b>How can we emphasize what makes Bramble new and exciting while keeping the experience grounded and reliable?</b> The specific goals we agreed on as a team to achieve that balance and bring Bramble’s functionality to life were:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Highlight the flat-fee rebate model early and clearly</b>, since it’s one of Bramble’s primary selling points</li>
                    <li><b>Make the search experience intuitive and guided</b>, so new users aren’t intimidated by the website</li>
                    <li><b>Promote buyer and seller agency</b>; the <b>interface should make users feel in control</b> of their journey from start to finish</li>
                </ul>            
            </p>

            <h2>Exploring Diverse Layouts</h2>
            <p>To begin our design process, each member of our team brainstormed a distinct design for Bramble’s desktop interface. Each set of sketches focused on exploring different layouts, visual hierarchies, and flows for the core user actions we established in the form of a home page, explore page, and FAQ page! (Note: 1-Rahel, 2-Jowet, 3-Annie, 4-Selena)
            </p>
            <h2>Homepage Sketches</h2>

              <h2>Bringing It All Together with a Wireframe</h2>
              <p>After generating four distinct design concepts, we combined the strongest elements from each to create a cohesive, user-centered desktop interface for Bramble. Our final wireframes reflect intentional decisions drawn from our diverse sketches, balancing clarity, trust, and innovation.</p>

        <h2>Incorporating Feedback Into Prototype</h2>
        <h5>When developing our figma prototype, we sought feedback from TAs. This is what we learned:</h5>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Feedback From TAs (Wireframe compare & contrast) </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In our initial wireframe, we only had one screen on the homepage that was set at the normal screen size and was not scrollable. However when we presented this screen to the TA, she felt like the <b>information was overwhelming</b> so we <b>took advantage of a scrollable homescreen</b> when we created the hifi figma design. Instead of having a home screen with a short description of the company, search page, how to guide, and a house sold by Bramble in one frame,<b> we decided to have the opening frame be the brand message, search bar, and description of the differentiating features</b> at Bramble. Then below that we added a how to guide and a house thats ready to be sold.
            </li>
            <li>
                The TA also mentioned that looking at our wireframe she did not understand how Bramble leveraged AI on its platform to increase the efficiency of the home buying process. So to clarify the confusion we added a section to the homepage describing Bramble’s AI workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
                The TA recommend including visuals to the how to guide, however we felt that it would crowd the section and that our descriptions were clear enough
            </li>
            <li>In our wireframe, the house cards were not clearly clickable, so we added an expand button to indicate that users can open them.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also shared with the TA our plans for including our about and sell page to the hifi prototype and received positive feedback.  
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Feedback from Bramble (changes to figma, if any)</h3>
        After developing our final prototype (part 4) 
        <ul>
            <li>We did not get a chance to implement the changes provided by the CEO but we greatly appreciated him taking the time to provide feedback. 
            </li>
            <li>The CEO <b>suggested using a different secondary color</b>, as Bramble berry doesn’t work well for backgrounds and should be used sparingly. We felt like the colors went well together but have liked to <b>experiment with different color schema</b> if we had more time. 
            </li>
            <li>He recommended <b>clarifying the search bar functionality</b> to better guide users on how to use it and highlight the three search queries offered by Bramble: by address, by link and by natural language search.
            </li>
            <li>He noted that some parts of the UI, like filters and the expanded home view, could be <b>simplified or made more visual to improve clarity and usability</b>.
            </li>
            <li>Additionally, he appreciated the emphasis on visuals, especially the property display screen, and encouraged exploring video integration.

      <section>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Future Changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding more functionality to filter and search
            </li>
            <li>Adding additional listings to motivate use of AI features</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <h5>Once we iterated on our prototype, we conducted user tests to analyze usabiity of an essential overarching task.</h5>  
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Overarching Task</h3>
        <p><b>Find a home based on your personal preferences and view the full listing details of a property that interests you.</b><br/>
            This task reflects the core functionality and user value of Bramble: helping users efficiently find homes that meet their unique preferences through an AI-powered experience. Buying a home is a central use case for our platform, and allowing users to apply filters and view detailed property information directly addresses real-world user goals. 
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Results</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users repeatedly <b>tried to use the inactive search bar</b> and <b>expected more filter options</b> for homes like schools. Many found the current filters useful but limited or non-functional, leading to <b>confusion</b> and <b>frustration</b>.
            </li>
            <li>While <b> users were intrigued by the idea of AI</b> (especially semantic search), <b>many couldn’t see where or how AI was integrated</b> during their interaction. They <b>suggested more visible emphasis and explanation of AI functionality</b> in key touchpoints. This shows that even <b>despite the informational section on our homepage</b> when a user wants to buy a home <b>they might skip over large text sections</b>.
            </li>
            <li> Users <b>appreciated the aesthetic, friendly design and layout</b>. After acknowledging that some features on the prototype were not functional, <b>each user was able to navigate to the house card and complete the task. </b>
            </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Throughout our iterative design process, our team learned the <b>importance of balancing user needs with business goals</b> and <b>continuously improving based on feedback</b>. Let quickly highlight a few key parts of this process:
            <ol>
                <li><b>We started with a bunch of different sketches, then combined the strongest ideas into a wireframe</b> that aligned with Bramble’s business goals.
                </li>
                <li><b>After presenting to our TA, we made improvements</b> like turning our home screen into a scrollable page, adding clearer visual structure, and making elements like listing cards more obviously clickable.
                </li>
                <li><b>We recognized a recurring challenge as users struggled to understand how AI was integrated</b> into the company. So we reached out to the CEO and learned more about the AI features. Now that we were better informed<b> we decided to include a section explaining Bramble’s AI workflows</b> on the landing page.
                </li>
                <li><b>User testing ensured the functionality of our hifi prototype </b>and allowed us to see the interactions of those not familiar with the class or project!
                </li>
                <li><b>We then reached out to the CEO again to share our final prototype and get his feedback.</b> Although we did not have the time to implement the changes he suggested we were satisfied with the positive comments he made and that he felt like we accurately conveyed his mission and business goals. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall, we learned to appreciate the collaboration and back and forth nature of designing a functional application. If we had more time, we would focus on making the product more interactive. <b>This project taught us a lot about designing with users in mind and being open to change along the way to increase the memorability, learnability and efficiency of an application. </b>

                </li>
            </ol>
