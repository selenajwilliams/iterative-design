          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Bramble is a Y Combinator AI-backed real estate brokerage platform that provides end-to-end home buying services for a flat fee, cutting out the standard percentage commission model. By using an AI video search model, buyers are able to customize their search and sellers are able to reach their target audience faster. 
          </p>

          <h2>Reimagining the Real Estate Experience with Bramble</h2>
          <p><i>What does it take to build trust in a platform that promises to save you tens of thousands of dollars?</i>
            That’s the question that guided our team as we took on the challenge of redesigning Bramble’s desktop website. As a new real estate brokerage with bold claims and cutting-edge technology, Bramble needs an interface that not only reflects its innovation but also instills confidence in buyers and sellers navigating one of the most important decisions of their lives.

          <h2>Part 1
          </h2>
  
      <div class="qa-section">
          <h3>What is the process of interacting with each component like? What's different?</h3>
          <p>
              The process of interacting with the Spotify and Photos dropdown menu was pretty similar and standard across 
              most applications I have interacted with. However, Revolve has more qualities of a retail site dropdown menu, 
              as you can easily accidentally exit the dropdown menu while trying to navigate through it if your mouse goes 
              slightly out of the frame. Meanwhile, even if the mouse is not within the contents of the dropdown menu for 
              Spotify or Photos, it will still remain open until you interact with a different component.
          </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="qa-section">
          <h3>What are all the functions the component can do (or can’t do)?</h3>
          <p>
              For Spotify and Photos, you cannot use Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V within the menu. However, you can press ESC to exit 
              the menu, use the arrow keys to navigate menu choices, use Tab to exit the menu (only for Spotify), and press 
              Return to select within the menu. Meanwhile, Revolve’s dropdown menu is not responsive to keyboard input—the 
              site is only responsive to the arrow keys for scrolling.
          </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="qa-section">
          <h3>What functionalities of the component are learnable, memorable, and efficient?</h3>
          <p>
              The functionalities of Spotify and Photos are learnable because the order remains consistent across different 
              playlists and photo collections, which increases memorability. Revolve, however, lacks these qualities since 
              its dropdown menus vary depending on product categories (dresses, clothing, sale, etc.), meaning the content 
              changes frequently. Additionally, Revolve’s dropdown menu is inefficient since it is very easy to accidentally 
              exit while trying to select an option near the bottom.

              <h3>Where did the components you observed do well in terms of usability and accessibility? How have you applied this to your design?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>One accessibility consideration not addressed in the Revolve dropdown was how quickly it exits the menu whenever the mouse is not hovering through the dropdown. If a user has low visibility, they may struggle to navigate through the menu without it constantly closing. This is a form of exclusion because it hinders their ability to use this component.</li>
                  <li>Spotify has two different options for sorting, but listing them in a vertical design makes it harder for people with low visibility.Additionally, the screen reader struggled to interact with the options inside the menu and would not read them out properly.</li>
                  <li>Photos performed well in terms of usability, but the focus order could be improved by increasing the usability of the Tab key. The screen reader was unreliable when using the touchpad but performed much better with a keyboard. However, as discussed in the video, not everyone has access to a keyboard, so the screen reader functionality needs to be more inclusive.</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="qa-section">
              <h3>Are there accessibility considerations that were not addressed that you accounted for in your own design?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>I accounted for the low visibility scenario in my design by making the menu horizontal with a dividing line to indicate that there are two distinct selection choices for every playlist between the “Sort by” and “View as” lists.Changing the “Sort by” selection to a checkmark improved memorability and, in turn, accessibility by creating consistency that can help users with low vision.
                  A screen reader should be able to recognize and read a checkmark for the selected option in both menus, improving navigation for visually impaired users.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
      
          <div class="qa-section">
              <h3>How does the change you’ve made in your own design solve for a “mismatch” in our world?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>My redesign fixes a mismatch between how users naturally interact with selection menus and the dropdown’s current confusing layout.
                  The existing design forces users to work harder to distinguish between sorting and viewing options, making interactions less intuitive.
                  By restructuring it horizontally and adding a dividing line, I make it clearer that "Sort by" and "View as" are separate options.
                  Swapping the up-arrow for a green checkmark improves consistency, making it easier to recognize selections.
                  Standardizing dropdown behavior ensures a more predictable experience, while enhanced hover states improve accessibility.
                  These changes make the dropdown more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly, addressing the mismatch described in the video.</li>

              <h3>Give two examples of how the accessibility/inaccessibility of those inputs or outputs could also impact users with impairments either positively or negatively.</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Spotify's dropdown allows navigation using the Up and Down arrow keys, Tab, and Return key. This is beneficial for users with motor impairments who may struggle with precise mouse movements—such as people with tremors—but can efficiently navigate using a keyboard.
                  <li>In Spotify, the dropdown menu immediately exits after selecting a sorting method but remains open after selecting a view option. This inconsistency can be confusing for users with cognitive impairments, attention disorders, or those who rely on predictable interactions.</li>

              <h3>Between mouse, keyboard, touch/mobile, and screen reader users, which do you think are most commonly prioritized in the process of creating components? How might this impact the user experience?</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>On desktop, I think mouse/touchpad interaction is most commonly prioritized, as the majority of users interact with sites and apps using these inputs.
                  However, similar to how the presenter discussed the importance of playground design for fostering community, most social interactions now happen online.
                  It is crucial to prioritize accessibility for all users and create a sense of belonging across web pages and applications to reduce the presence of mismatches.
                  This can impact user experience in almost every aspect of life, from scheduling a doctor’s appointment online to ordering groceries, completing schoolwork, or transferring money.
                  If a user cannot fully interact with a website’s components, they may miss important information or be unable to complete essential tasks.</li>
